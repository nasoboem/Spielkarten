# Spielkarten
Hi,
this is a package for students of the programming language Go that implements playing cards.
The package implements different decks depending what type of game you want to implement with them. There are decks with 32 and 52 cards implemented and also for memory a 104 deck as well. If one takes an even number of cards from that memory deck allows to choose different amounts of cards for your memory game.

All the other usual function for cards are implemented you will find all the information with in the package  - unfortunately in German!

If you have any questions you can send me an e-mail.
Have fun!!
